# Phase 2 Complete: Background Processing System ✅

## What We Built

### 🤖 Always-Listening RSS Monitoring
- **Automated RSS Polling**: Continuous monitoring every 15-30 minutes
- **Multi-User Support**: Handles all users simultaneously 
- **Smart Deduplication**: Prevents storing the same release twice
- **30-Day Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old releases
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks all polling attempts and results

### 🔗 API Endpoints Built

#### Core RSS Polling
- **`POST /api/poll-rss`** - Poll RSS feeds for authenticated user
- **`GET /api/poll-rss`** - Get recent poll logs for user

#### Cron Job Management  
- **`POST /api/cron/poll-all-users`** - Poll RSS for ALL users (protected)
- **`GET /api/cron/poll-all-users`** - Health check
- **`POST /api/cron/cleanup`** - Clean up old releases (protected)
- **`GET /api/cron/cleanup`** - Health check

### 🛡️ Security & Auth
- **User Authentication**: Regular API calls require valid session
- **Cron Secret Protection**: Background jobs protected by `CRON_SECRET`
- **Internal User Passing**: Cron jobs can act on behalf of users safely
- **Row Level Security**: Database isolation maintained

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- **Poll Logs Table**: Tracks every RSS polling attempt
- **Success/Failure Tracking**: Detailed error reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and processing stats
- **Health Checks**: Easy monitoring of system status

## Files Created

✅ **Smart Deduplication**: No duplicate releases stored  
✅ **30-Day History**: Configurable retention with automatic cleanup  
✅ **Production Ready**: Proper auth, logging, and error handling  
✅ **Easy Monitoring**: Health checks and comprehensive logging  

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Check what environment variables you need
npm run check-env

# This will show you exactly what to set in .env.local
```

### 2. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Apply the Phase 1 migration (includes Phase 2 tables)
npm run migrate
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
# Start your development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the system
npm run test:phase2
```

### 4. Set Up Cron Jobs
Choose your deployment method:

**For Vercel (Easiest)**:
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/poll-all-users",
      "schedule": "*/20 * * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/cleanup",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**For External Cron Service**:
- Use cron-job.org or similar
- Poll every 20 minutes: `POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/poll-all-users`
- Daily cleanup: `POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/cleanup`
- Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret`

## 📈 Production Deployment Checklist

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Unauthorized" Errors**
- Check `CRON_SECRET` is set correctly
- Verify authorization header format

**"No companies found"**
- Users must add companies through UI first
- Check database has user companies

**RSS Fetch Failures**
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is correct
- Check RSS sources are accessible
- Monitor rate limiting

**Database Issues**
- Ensure migration was applied
- Check Supabase credentials
- Verify RLS policies

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Environment check
npm run check-env

# Test system health
npm run test:phase2

# Manual cron test (with server running)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/poll-all-users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"
```
